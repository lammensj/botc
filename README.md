# ‚ö°Ô∏èSPARC by Drupal

## TLDR;
SPARC is Solar Powered, Advanced, Renewable Control for optimizing self-consumption of electricty.

## Introduction
SPARC is an idea on how to solve the problem that, as a home owner with a photovoltaic system, we're pushed to reduce energy usage from non-renewable sources like coal or nuclear. But how can you do that without investing in a ton of smart devices and an energy management system of a specific vendor? Are you comfortable that your appliances are connected to the outside world? I mean, those platforms and those integrations are still developed and managed by humans, and thus error-prone (1)(2).

What I wanted to achieve, is very simple: when I rise in the morning, I want to see a notification on my phone on how to schedule my dishwasher and/or my washing machine. I can then prepare them, delay their execution and go to work.
But also ask questions: "What's the best time period today to start the pyrolysis-process of my oven?", "Give me an overview of the estimated output for the next 5 days.".

By levering Drupal, it has become a project consisting of contrib and custom modules for time-based storage, processing via SOLID-principles and logging the output in a message-like way.

- ‚ùì Provide http-integration for the [Forecast.Solar](https://forecast.solar/)-API
- ‚úÖ Run an InfluxDB-service
- ‚úÖ Provide php-integration for the InfluxDB-service
- ‚úÖ Provide php-integration for Discord
- ‚úÖ Create ECA-models for fetching data and providing calculations

## Methodology
I'm a huge fan of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and the framework it offers. Combining contributed and custom modules, together with ECA-models, results in a project (not product) which allows me to implement the listed features.

### Contrib Modules
- [BPMN.iO](https://www.drupal.org/project/bpmn_io): BPMN.iO is a BPMN modeller for [ECA](https://www.drupal.org/project/eca) and is fully integrated into Drupal's admin UI.
- [ECA: Event - Condition - Action](https://www.drupal.org/project/eca): ECA is a powerful, versatile, and user-friendly rules engine for Drupal 9+. The core module is a processor that validates and executes event-condition-action plugins;
- [ECA Tamper Integration](https://www.drupal.org/project/eca_tamper): Integrates [ECA](https://www.drupal.org/project/eca) with [Tamper](https://www.drupal.org/project/tamper);
- [HTTP Client Manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/http_client_manager): Http Client Manager introduces a new Guzzle based plugin which allows you to manage HTTP clients using Guzzle Service Descriptions via YAML, JSON or PHP files, in a simple and efficient way;
### Contributed Modules
- [DiscordPHP](https://www.drupal.org/project/discord_php): using the [team-reflex/discord-php](https://github.com/discord-php/DiscordPHP)-package, this module offers a drush-command to start the included ReactPHP-loop and dispatches Symfony-events for certain things that happen inside it;
- [Solcast](https://www.drupal.org/project/solcast): this module exposes HTTP Client Manager-resources for the Solcast API. This platform provides solar resource assessment and forecasting data for irradiance and PV power;
### Custom Modules
- InfluxbDB: there's an existing PHP-package for talking with an InfluxDB-instance ([influxdata/influxdb-client-php](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-php)), but it lacked an integration for Drupal. This module provides some general configuration, the option to perform operations on Buckets and a couple of ECA-actions to create and write Points.
- SPARC - Core: implementation of the core-functionalities
  - `Drupal\sparc_core\Commands\ScheduleCommand`: calculates and outputs a schedule for a set of given appliances
  - `Drupal\sparc_core\Plugin\Action\ExecuteDrushCommand`: action to execute a drush-command
### ECA-Models
- Discord:
  - Logs a message when the underlying ReactPHP-loop is ready to receive events
  - Executes a drush command when an incoming message starts with `/drush`and responds with the output
- Solcast
  - Calls the configured http-client endpoint, parses the json-response by creating Points and sending them to InfluxDB
