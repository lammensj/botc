# SPARC by Drupal

## Intro
SPARC stands for Solar Powered, Advanced, Renewable Control. In essense, it's an idea about the consumption of electricty, coming from solar panels, but without the need for cloud-connected devices. It can propose schedules, based on estimated output and the power requirements of a set of appliances.

It's become a tool which solves the question "How can I optimise my self-consumption of electricity?". By using Drupal, it leverages a set of modules for time-based storage, processing and logging the output.
