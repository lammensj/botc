# SPARC by Drupal

## TLDR;
SPARC is Solar Powered, Advanced, Renewable Control for optimizing self-consumption of electricty.

## Introduction
SPARC is an idea on how to solve the problem that, as a home owner with a photovoltaic system, we're pushed to reduce energy usage from non-renewable sources like coal or nuclear. But how can you do that without investing in a ton of smart devices and an energy management system of a specific vendor? Are you comfortable that your appliances are connected to the outside world? I mean, those platforms and those integrations are still developed and managed by humans, and thus error-prone (1)(2).

What I wanted to achieve, is very simple: when I rise in the morning, I want to see a notification on my phone on how to schedule my dishwasher and/or my washing machine. I can then prepare them, delay their execution and go to work.
But also ask questions: "What's the best time period today to start the pyrolysis-process of my oven?", "Give me an overview of the estimated output for the next 5 days.".

By levering Drupal, it has become a project consisting of contrib and custom modules for time-based storage, processing via SOLID-principles and logging the output in a message-like way.
